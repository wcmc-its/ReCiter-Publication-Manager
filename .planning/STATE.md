# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-16)

**Core value:** Curators and administrators can reliably log in, navigate without broken UI, and have fine-grained control over who curates publications for which groups of people.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Auth Fix and Bug Remediation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Auth Fix and Bug Remediation)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-16 — Completed Plan 01-01 (capability-based auth model)

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 50%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 4min
- Total execution time: 0.07 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 1 | 4min | 4min |

**Recent Trend:**

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Auth fix is Phase 1 blocker; all other work depends on it
- [Roadmap]: UI bugs grouped with auth fix at coarse granularity (shared "fix what's broken" boundary)
- [Roadmap]: UI/UX audit (Phase 2) precedes scoped roles (Phase 3) so new UI follows audit patterns
- [01-01]: Baseline access grants canReport + canSearch to all authenticated users even with zero roles
- [01-01]: SAML auto-create uses CWID-only for person table matching (findOnePerson only accepts uid)
- [01-01]: Notifications menu hidden via capabilityKey=canNotifications (always false) until feature is ready

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Verify SAML certificate expiry before writing auth fix code; the /noaccess issue could be a certificate rotation problem
- [Research]: Confirm MySQL version supports CHECK constraints (8.0.16+ required) before Phase 3 schema work
- [Research]: Validate @axe-core/react compatibility with React 16 before committing to it in Phase 2
